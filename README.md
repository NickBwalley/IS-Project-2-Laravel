# Employee Resource Management System.
Our project, titled **"Improving Food Security Through Nutrition-Smart Agriculture,"** focused on enhancing agricultural practices while streamlining employee remuneration processes at **Kinyanjui Farm in Limuru, Kenya.** By aligning nutrition-smart strategies with efficient financial management systems, our goal was to promote sustainable farming and improve productivity. This project was successfully executed through the collective efforts of our team of five dedicated members: Lesley Tulienge, Sarah Mongare, Angela Kinya, Millicent Cheptoi, and Nicholas Bwalley. Each team member played a critical role in researching, analyzing, and implementing innovative solutions that contributed to the success of this initiative. Their collaborative efforts and unwavering commitment were instrumental in achieving our project objectives and making a meaningful impact on the farmâ€™s operations.
